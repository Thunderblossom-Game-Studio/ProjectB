The goal is to create an area of effect where objects fall down, depending on where they fall different things happen.

The two major differences for each is the way the volcano is triggered:

    PVP: Timer based ⇾ The objects fall down on a timed interval.
    PVE: Player detection ⇾ The objects fall down once players are nearby. If there are no players nearby, the volcano stops.
    These should be inspector properties that LD can edit

Volcano Mechanics:

    Objects that fall from the sky within a circular area
    These objects will have a random size within a set range. Editable in inspector.
    When the objects hit the ground, they leave behind lava pools. The size of the pools is dictated by the determined size of the falling object. (As seen in the above bullet point).
    Lava pools disappear after an X amount of time. Editable in inspector.

Damage:

    If the object hits the player instead of the ground, it will deal damage to the player and disappear.
    Player's behaviour with the lava pool:
        They take damage while in the pool
        They are set on fire
        They are slowed down
    Communicate with Jake to implement the actual dealing of the damage. The damage should be implemented after every other aspect of the volcano is done

Indicators

    Work with the assigned member of Assets Department to implement the falling indicator so that the player knows where the objects are falling.
